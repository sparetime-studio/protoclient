protoclient
===========

This is a client based on windows and developed by using vs2013, which is used to test the server protocol 
when its protocol is made by google's protobuf.

It also contains protobuf2.6.0 for easy generating the protobuf library.

For now, it lets you set the protobuf data in the user interface but if you want to send it to your server,
 it is necessary to consider the head of the package you send. So you may modify the code to specify the head of
 the package suitable for your server protocol.
